## **Theme 3: Destiny vs Choice**

In the narrative of "Holes", the themes of destiny and choice are woven into the lives of the two main characters, Stanley Yelnats and Zero, presenting a compelling exploration of whether our lives are governed by fate or the choices we make.

### Stanley Yelnats: From Curse to Control

And I will firstly talk about Stanley Yelnats, who is burdened by a family curse that seems to follow him to Camp Green Lake.  

However, Stanley choose to fight against the curse. well, He **"risks his life to rescue Zero, who has run away from the camp."** By making this choice, Stanley embarks on a path that not only challenges the curse but also leads him to discover his true potential and the strength to shape his own future.

### Zero: From Zero to Hero

On the other hand, Zero is a character who is often overlooked and underestimated by those around him. His small stature and lack of self-confidence make him an easy target for dismissal. However, his role in the story is far from insignificant. 

Zero's act of sharing his limited supplies and his selfless decision to help Stanley dig holes **"lays the foundation for their friendship"** 

and marks his transformation into a hero.

In conclusion, Stanley's struggle against the family curse and Zero's transformation from a background character to a hero are powerful illustrations of how our choices can shape our destinies.  
Through their journeys, we are reminded that we have the power to choose our paths, to fight against predetermined narratives, and to write our own stories.
