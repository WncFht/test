**Introduction**

In the article "Tales we tell: the portrayal of mothers in four popular children’s fairy tales and the influence on reading," authors Sibhekinkosi Anna Nkomo and Aaliya Kimmie delve into the realm of children's literature to scrutinize the depiction of mothers in four iconic fairy tales: Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Rapunzel.  
The authors argue that these tales often present a dichotomous view of mothers, painting them either as nurturing and loving or as wicked and cruel. This portrayal, they suggest, has profound implications for how children perceive motherhood and gender roles.  
Building on the authors' thesis, I propose that while these traditional portrayals offer a starting point for discussion, there is a growing need for children's literature to reflect the multifaceted nature of modern motherhood and family structures.

**Summary**

In their article "Tales we tell: the portrayal of mothers in four popular children’s fairy tales and the influence on reading," Sibhekinkosi Anna Nkomo and Aaliya Kimmie set out to examine how mothers are depicted in a selection of well-known fairy tales and the potential impact of these portrayals on young readers. The authors aim to shed light on the enduring yet potentially harmful stereotypes of mothers as either wholly good or evil, and how such depictions could shape children's views on gender roles and family structures. They analyze four fairy tales, identifying the dichotomous representation of mothers and discussing the implications this may have for children's developing perceptions. The authors' thesis is that these stories, while enchanting, may also perpetuate outdated and one-dimensional views of motherhood that require critical examination. By summarizing the key arguments and findings, the article invites readers to consider the importance of diverse and nuanced representations in children's literature.  
**Analysis**

In their analysis "Tales we tell: the portrayal of mothers in four popular children’s fairy tales and the influence on reading," Sibhekinkosi Anna Nkomo and Aaliya Kimmie adeptly apply social semiotic theory to deconstruct the dichotomous depiction of mothers in Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Rapunzel. They persuasively argue that these portrayals, often reducing mothers to either idealized or vilified figures, have a profound impact on children's perceptions of gender and family. The authors support their thesis with direct references to the tales, illustrating how linguistic and visual cues frame mothers as either wholly nurturing or wicked, which in turn perpetuates societal stereotypes. Their methodical examination, underpinned by a clear purpose to inform and persuade, effectively highlights the need for a more nuanced portrayal of motherhood in children's literature.

**Response**

In response to Nkomo and Kimmie's examination of mother portrayals in classic fairy tales, a critical perspective that warrants deeper exploration is the potential for these tales to serve as educational tools for moral and social development, rather than solely as perpetuators of stereotypes.

While the authors highlight the dichotomous depiction of mothers as either nurturing or wicked and argue for the potential harm in reinforcing such stereotypes, it's essential to consider the educational value of these clear moral distinctions. Fairy tales, with their distinct good and evil characters, provide a simplified framework for children to understand complex social concepts. For instance, the evil stepmother in "Cinderella" is not just a malevolent figure but also a catalyst for Cinderella's growth, illustrating the concept of resilience and the triumph of good over adversity. This narrative device can be instrumental in teaching children about empathy, justice, and the importance of moral integrity. As noted by folklorist Jack Zipes, fairy tales often serve to "educate children about the dangers of the world while also providing them with the tools to navigate it" (Zipes, 1994).

The educational utility of these tales is further supported by educational psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, who argued that fairy tales provide a safe space for children to explore and process fears and anxieties. In his seminal work, "The Uses of Enchantment," Bettelheim states that the clear delineation between good and evil characters allows children to navigate complex emotions and societal norms in a controlled narrative environment (Bettelheim, 1976). This psychological scaffolding can be crucial for their cognitive and emotional development.

Moreover, the binary portrayal of mothers in these tales can also be seen as a reflection of the archetypes that Carl Jung discussed—the great mother and the wicked stepmother representing different aspects of the collective unconscious. Jungian scholar Clarissa Pinkola Estés emphasizes that these archetypes serve as narrative devices that help children understand the world around them and the different roles people play (Estés, 1992).

It's also important to note that the educational value of these tales isn't static. As society evolves, so too can the interpretation and retelling of these stories. Modern adaptations of classic fairy tales often revise these traditional portrayals, presenting more complex characters and narratives that challenge the stereotypes identified by Nkomo and Kimmie. For example, the character of the stepmother in the musical "Cinderella" (2013) is portrayed with more depth, showing her actions as a product of her own past and insecurities, rather than as an inherent evil. This shift reflects a broader trend in contemporary literature to provide more nuanced portrayals of female characters, as seen in adaptations like "Into the Woods" (Lapine & Sondheim, 1986).

In conclusion, while Nkomo and Kimmie raise valid concerns about the portrayal of mothers in classic fairy tales, it's crucial to also recognize the educational potential of these stories. They can serve as tools for moral and social education, providing children with a framework to understand complex social dynamics and emotional processes. By considering the educational value and the evolving nature of these tales, we can appreciate their role in children's literature as more than just perpetuators of stereotypes.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, while Nkomo and Kimmie have highlighted the dichotomous portrayal of mothers in classic fairy tales and the potential impact on children's perceptions of gender roles, it is essential to also recognize the educational potential of these stories. They serve as more than perpetuators of stereotypes; instead, they offer a framework for teaching moral and social values. As society evolves, so too should the interpretation and retelling of these tales, providing an opportunity to foster critical thinking and empathy in young readers. The enduring value of these stories lies in their ability to both entertain and educate, preparing children for the complexities of the real world. It is through this lens that we should continue to evaluate and adapt the stories we share with children, ensuring they promote a more inclusive and dynamic understanding of the world.
