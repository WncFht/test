In Louis Sachar's 'Holes,' the theme of friendship is intricately woven into the narrative. And I want to focus on the loyalty of the friendship which resonate deeply with my experience.  

From my point of view, I think the loyalty is the essential and fundamental part of friendship. In the book, Stanley Yelnats and Zero never had doubts about their friendship and were loyal to each other. Alough the environment was harsh, they helped each other and eventually escaped the Camp Green Lake. It is the loyalty glittering in their friendship that allowed them overcome conflicts and contributed to their personal growth, which relfects the significance of loyalty in friendship.  
As for me, I've fortunately encountered several friends in my high school. However, every time we were not loyalty to each other, our frienship would swiftly break up and hurted both side. The paiful experience always reminds me of that loyalty is the fundamental part of friendship.  

Last but not least, Loyalty is a cornerstone of friendship, especially within the context of Chinese society where the concept of 'renqing' (人情), or personal relationships, plays a significant role. In everyday life, loyalty is evident in the way friends stand by each other during personal crises, offering emotional support and practical assistance. The importance of loyalty is further emphasized during festivals like the Spring Festival, where friends and family members exchange gifts and well-wishes, reinforcing the bonds of loyalty and friendship.  

In conclusion, the loyalty displayed in "Holes" resonates with my personal experiences and the cultural emphasis on 'renqing' in China, highlighting its essential role in friendships. The story and my life both confirm that loyalty therefore, is the foundation of strong and enduring relationships across different cultures and contexts.
